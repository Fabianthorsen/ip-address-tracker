## Overview

### The challenge

- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### Continued development

- [ ] Improve solution to either look more like the design provded or improve with custom design
- [ ] Exploring how to improve solution by using other hooks such as `useCallback` or `useMemo`
- [ ] Redo the task in SolidJS
- [ ] Change API to something that is more "freemium" as the current is quite expensive, and may result in this solution not working well
